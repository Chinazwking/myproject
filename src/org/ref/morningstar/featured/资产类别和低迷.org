* 经济衰退期债券收益率
  债券收益率受贷款供求、货币政策和通胀预期等因素驱动.
  [[file:../../../res/image/01.png]]
  1. 美联邦使用联邦基金利率和现金贴现率作为其实施货币政策的主要工具. 经济衰退期,
     降低利率; 经济扩张期, 调高利率
  2. 短期债券利率波动较大, 长期债券利率相对稳定
  3. 通货膨胀也会影响利率(主要是长期), 通货膨胀越严重, 债券贬值越多, 为了避免亏损
     利率反而会升高

  请记住，债券收益率和价格走势相反。当新债券的收益率下降时，收益率较高的现有债
  券会变得更有价值，相反，当新债券的收益率上升时，现有债券的价格就会下跌，以与
  对新债券的需求增加进行竞争。

* 股票回报和货币政策
股票回报与货币政策的变化相吻合
经济和股市都是周期性的, 美联储通过改变基金利率来影响市场走向：
- 经济衰退 :: 降低基金利率->货币供应提高->银行提高放贷->刺激投资消费
- 经济过热 :: 提高基金利率->货币供应降低->银行减少放贷->投资消费放缓

该图说明了美联储货币政策, 市场回报和衰退期之间的关系. 从历史上看, 衰退时期的特点
是股市表现不佳和联邦基金利率下降. 衰退期结束的标志是股市表现出色. 很难预测经济周
期的确切持续时间, 但在大多数情况下, 美联储的行动和随之而来的利率变动与股票表现的
上下波动相吻合.

* 各种资产类别和市场的相关性
相关度是用来衡量两种投资变化相关程度的指标, 相关性越高, 投资表现的相关性就越高.
在萧条时期, 投资者都希望自己的投资类别和市场的相关性越小越好. 但是, 很多投资者
使用分散投资组合, 结果也有很大的亏损.
原因在于多元化投资是有弱点的, 很多长期看起来多元化的投资, 在遭受重大市场冲击后,
它们的结构可能会发生变化, 相关性可能会提高, 此时多元化已经不那么"多元"了.
下表展示了三个时间段内资产类别和市场的相关性:

所以分散投资不是银弹, 长期证券也可能亏损.
** 相关系数
按照年月化相关系数, 相关性可以分为三类:
- 低相关度: 0-0.33
- 中相关度: 0.33-0.66
- 高相关度: 0.66-1
** 商品交易的风险
因为商品交易具有高风险和潜在的巨大损失, 所以除非您真的了解您的交易及合约, 以及您
面临的风险. 否则不要进行商品交易.
商品交易面临的风险包括但不限于: 监管, 经济和政治情况, 天气, 自然灾害, 市场中断,
如果是国际商品交易还会面临货币波动, 关税, 流动性, 审计和财务标准差异等风险
** 房地产信托, 股票和证券的风险
- REIT的风险是固定的, 比如本地经济情况, 利率波动, 信用风险, 流动性等等
- 小型股票比大型股票更加容易变化, 都受到价格波动, 商业风险, 交易量小等因素的影响
- 政府证券有充分的信用担保, 因为政府会定期支付本金和利息
- 投资者作为债权人时, 公司证券存在违约的风险

* 金融危机之后的美国市场复苏, 平衡的投资组合
Stock prices suffer during financial crises. However, a balanced portfolio can help mitigate some of the risk.

This image illustrates the cumulative returns of a balanced (60% stock/40% bond) portfolio after six historical U.S. financial crises. In the short term, uncertainty from such external shocks can create sudden drops in value. For example, the balanced portfolio posted a negative return in the month following three of the six analyzed crises. Over longer periods of time, however, returns were much more attractive, and investors who stayed the course reaped considerable rewards.

Beware of fear
Fear and uncertainty might lead investors to sell their investments during tough times, putting downward pressure on prices. Trading because of these emotions can be detrimental to a portfolio’s value. By selling during downward price pressures, investors might realize short-term losses. Furthermore, this is compounded as investors wait and hesitate to get back into the market, possibly missing some or all of the potential recovery. The lesson here is that patience can pay dividends.

THINGS TO KNOW
The lesson here is that patience can pay dividends.
Diversification is a valuable strategy, but it has its limits
Diversification can also limit losses during turbulent market conditions. One of the main advantages of diversification is reducing risk over the long run, not necessarily increasing return. While stocks offer the potential for higher returns, the downside risk can also be extreme. A diversified portfolio can help mitigate such extreme swings in value.

Diversification does not eliminate the risk of experiencing investment losses. Government bonds are guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government as to the timely payment of principal and interest, while returns and principal invested in stocks are not guaranteed. Stocks have been more volatile than bonds.

Stock prices suffer during financial crises, but they typically recover over time.

This image illustrates the cumulative returns of an all-stock portfolio after six historical U.S. financial crises. In the short term, uncertainty from such external shocks can create sudden drops in value. For example, the all-stock portfolio posted a negative return in the month following four of the six analyzed crises. Over longer periods of time, however, returns were much more attractive, and investors who stayed the course reaped considerable rewards.

Patience is a virtue in investing
Fear and uncertainty might lead investors to sell their investments during tough times, putting downward pressure on prices. Trading because of these emotions can be detrimental to a portfolio’s value. By selling during downward price pressures, investors might realize short-term losses. Furthermore, this is compounded as investors wait and hesitate to get back into the market, possibly missing some or all of the potential recovery. The lesson here is that patience can pay dividends.

Returns and principal invested in stocks are not guaranteed.
* 总结
Skillful use of balancing and correlation can reduce the risk of loss during a market downturn. Different investments behave differently in different market conditions, though in rare cases they can behave contrary to how we would expect.

As seen in this course, a balanced portfolio can weather the test of time over the long term. As well, an all-stock portfolio also can. The key is patience.
